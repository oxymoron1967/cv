                <p>Marcel Proust wrote as many as ten or more letters per day. However, he didn't date most of them. Professor Philip Kolb collected much of Proust's correspondance and set about tyrign to date the letters. Kolb did this by cross-referencing things mentioned in Proust's letters, like important news events, cultural happenings or even the weather. HE piut his notes on index cards, and filed them by date. Kolb also did research on important people in Proust's luife, and filed that information in seperate files.</p><br>
